<b>
Dumbarton's drums, they sound so bonnie<br>
And they remind me of my Johnnie<br>
Such fond delight doth steal upon me<br>
When Johnnie kneels and kisses me.<p>

Across the fields o' bounding heather<br>
Dumbarton tolls the hour of pleasure<br>
A song of love that's without measure<br>
When Johnnie sings his songs to me.<p>

'Tis he alone that can delight me<br>
His roving eye, it doth invite me<br>
And when his tender arms enfold me<br>
The blackest night doth turn and flee.<p>

My Johnnie is a handsome laddie<br>
And though he is Dumbarton's caddie<br>
Some day I'll be a captain's lady<br>
When Johnnie tends his vows to me.
