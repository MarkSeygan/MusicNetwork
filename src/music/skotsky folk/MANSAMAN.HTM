<center><h2>A Man's A Man For A' That</h2></center>
<b>
Is there for honest poverty<br>
That hangs his head and a' that?<br>
The coward slave, we pass him by<br>
We daur be puir for a' that.<br>
For a' that, and a' that<br>
Our toils obscure, and a' that<br>
The rank is but the guinea's stamp<br>
The man's the gowd for a' that.<p>

Ye see yon birkie ca'd a lord<br>
Wha struts, and stares and a' that<br>
Tho' hundreds worship at his word<br>
He's but a coof for a' that.<br>
For a' that, and a' that<br>
His ribbon, star and a' that<br>
the man o' independence mind<br>
He looks and laughs at a' that.<p>

A king can make a belted knight<br>
A marquis, duke and a' that<br>
But an honest man's aboon his micht<br>
Gude faith, he maunna fa' all that<br>
For a' that, and a' that<br>
Their dignities and a' that<br>
The pith o' sense and pride o' worth<br>
Are higher ranks than a' that.<p>

Then let us pray that come it may<br>
As come it will for a' that<br>
That sense and worth o'er a' the earth<br>
May bear the gree and a' that<br>
For a' that, and a' that<br>
It's coming yet, for a' that<br>
When man to man the world o'er<br>
Shall brithers be for a' that.<p>
