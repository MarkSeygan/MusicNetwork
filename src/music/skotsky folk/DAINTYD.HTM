<b>
It was in and through the window broads<br>
And a' the tirlie wirlies o't<br>
The sweetest kiss that e'er I got<br>
Was from my Dainty Davie.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
Oh, leeze me on your curly pow<br>
Dainty Davie, Dainty Davie<br>
Leeze me on your curly pow<br>
My ain dear Dainty Davie.</i><p>

It was doon amang my Daddy's pease<br>
And underneath the cherry trees<br>
Oh, there he kissed me as he pleased<br>
For he was my ain dear Davie.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

When he was chased by a dragoon<br>
Into my bed he was laid doon<br>
I thought him worthy o' his room<br>
For he's my Dainty Davie.<p>

<i>Chorus (Twice)</i><p>
