<b>
Flow gently, sweet Afton, amang thy green braes<br>
Flow gently, I'll sing thee a song in thy praise<br>
My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream<br>
Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though stock-dove whose echo resounds from the hill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny dell<br>
Thou green created lapwing, thy screaming for bear<br>
I charge you, disturb not my slumbering fair.<p>

How lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighbouring hills<br>
Far marked with the courses of clear winding rills<br>
There daily I wander, as morn rises high<br>
My flocks and my Mary's sweet cot in my eye.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow<br>
There oft, as mild evening creeps over the lea<br>
The sweet scented birk shades my Mary and me.<p>

Thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides<br>
And winds by the cot where my Mary resides<br>
How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave<br>
As gathering sweet flow'rets, she stems thy clear wave.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow gently, sweet Afton, amang thy green braes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow gently , sweet river, the theme of my lays<br>
My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream<br>
Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.
