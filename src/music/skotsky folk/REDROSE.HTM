<b>
Oh, my love is like a red, red rose<br>
That's newly sprung in June<br>
Oh, my love is like a melody<br>
That's sweetly played in tune<br>
As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,<br>
So deep in love am I<br>
And I will love thee still, my dear,<br>
Till all the seas gang dry.<br>
Till all the seas gang dry, my dear,<br>
Till all the seas gang dry<br>
And I will love thee still, my dear,<br>
Till all the seas gang dry.<p>

'Til all the seas gang dry my, my dear<br>
And the rocks melt with the sun<br>
And I will love thee still, my dear<br>
While the sands of life shall run<br>
But faretheewell, my only love<br>
Oh, faretheewell a while<br>
And I will come again, my love<br>
Tho' 't were ten thousand mile<br>
Tho' 't were ten thousand mile, my love<br>
Tho' 't were ten thousand mile<br>
And I will come again, my love<br>
Tho' 't were ten thousand mile.
