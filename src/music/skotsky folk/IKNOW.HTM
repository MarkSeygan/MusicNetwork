<b>
I know where I'm going<br>
And I know who's going with me<br>
I know who I love<br>
And my dear knows who I'll marry.<p>

I have stockings of silk<br>
And shoes of bright green leather<br>
Combs to buckle my hair<br>
And a ring for every finger.<p>

O' feather beds are soft<br> 
And painted rooms are bonnie<br>
But I would give them all<br>
For my handsome winsome Johnny.<p>

Some say that he's poor<br>
But I say that he's bonnie<br>
Fairest of them all<br>
Is my handsome winsome Johnny.
