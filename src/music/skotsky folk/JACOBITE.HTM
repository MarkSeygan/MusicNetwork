<b>
Ye Jacobites by name, give an ear, give an ear<br>
Ye Jacobites by name, give an ear<br>
Ye Jacobites by name, your fautes I will proclaim<br>
Your doctrines I mun blame, you shall hear, you shall hear<br>
Your doctrines I mun blame, you shall hear.<p>

What is right and what is wrong, by the law, by the law?<br>
What is right and what is wrong by the law?<br>
What is right and what is wrong, a short sword and a long<br>
A weak arm and a strong for to draw, for to draw<br>
A weak arm and a strong for to draw.<p>

What makes heroic strife famed afar, famed afar?<br>
What makes heroic strife famed afar?<br>
What makes heroic strife, to whet the assassin's knife<br>
Or hunt a parent's life wi' bloody war, bloody war<br>
Or hunt a parent's life wi' bloody war?<p>

Then leave your schemes alone in the state, in the state<br>
Then leave your schemes alone in the state<br>
Then leave your schemes alone, adore the rising sun<br>
And leave a man alone to his fate, to his fate<br>
And leave a man alone to his fate.
