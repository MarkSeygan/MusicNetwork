<b>
The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want<br>
He makes me down to lie<br>
In pastures green; he leadeth me<br>
The quiet waters by.<p>

My soul he doth restore again<br>
And me to walk doth make<br>
Within the paths of righteousness<br>
Even for his own name's sake.<p>

Yea, though I walk through death's dark vale<br>
Yet will I fear no ill<br>
For thou art with me, and thy rod<br>
And staff me comfort still.<p>

My table thou has furnished<br>
In presence of my foes;<br>
My head thou dost with oil anoint<br>
And my cup overflows.<p>

Goodness and mercy all my life<br>
Shall surely follow me,<br>
And in God's house for evermore<br>
My dwelling-place shall be.
