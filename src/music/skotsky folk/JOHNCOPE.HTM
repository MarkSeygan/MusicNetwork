Cope sent a challenge frae Dunbar<br>
Sayin "Charlie meet me an' ye daur<br>
An' I'll learn ye the airt o' war<br>
If ye'll meet me in the morning."<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
O Hey! Johnnie Cope are ye waukin' yet?<br>
Or are your drums a-beating yet?<br>
If ye were waukin' I wad wait<br>
Tae gang tae the coals in the morning.</i><p>
                                           
When Charlie looked the letter upon<br>
He drew his sword and scabbard from<br>
Come, follow me, my merry men<br>
And we'll meet Johnnie Cope in the morning. <i>(Chorus)</i><p>

Now Johnnie, be as good as your word<br>
Come, let us try baith fire and sword<br>
And dinna flee like a frichted bird<br>
That's chased frae its nest i' the morning. <i>(Chorus)</i><p>

When Johnnie Cope he heard o' this<br>
He thocht it wouldna be amiss<br>
Tae hae a horse in readiness<br>
Tae flee awa in the morning. <i>(Chorus)</i><p>

Fye now, Johnnie, get up an' rin<br>
The Highland bagpipes mak' a din<br>
It's better tae sleep in a hale skin<br>
For it will be a bluidie morning. <i>(Chorus)</i><p>

When Johnnie Cope tae Dunbar cam<br>
They speired at him, "Where's  a' your men?"<br>
"The de'il confound me gin I ken<br>
For I left them a' in the morning." <i>(Chorus)</i><p>

Now Johnnie, troth  ye werena blate<br>
Tae come wi' news o' your ain defeat<br>
And leave your men in sic a strait<br>
Sae early in the morning. <i>(Chorus)</i><p>

In faith, quo Johnnie, I got sic flegs<br>
Wi' their claymores an' philabegs<br>
Gin I face them again, de'il brak my legs<br>
So I wish you a' good morning. <i>(Chorus)</i><p>
