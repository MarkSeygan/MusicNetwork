<b>
The sun has gane down o'er the lofty Ben Lomond<br>
And left the red clouds to reside o'er the scene<br>
While lanely I stray in the calm simmer gloamin'<br>
To muse on sweet Jessie, the flow'r o' Dunblane.<br>
How sweet is the brier wi' its saft faulding blossom<br>
And sweet is the birk wi' its mantle o' green<br>
But sweeter and fairer and dear to this bosom<br>
Is charming young Jessie, the flow'r o' Dunblane.<br>
Is charming young Jessie, is charming young Jessie<br>
Is charming young Jessie, the flow'r o' Dunblane.<p>

She's modest as on-y and blythe as she's bonnie<br>
For guileless simplicity makes her its aim<br>
And far be the villain, divested of feeling<br>
Wha'd blight in its bloom, the sweet flow'r of Dunblane.<br>
Sing on, thou sweet mavis, thy hymn to the evening<br>
Thour't dear to the echoes of Calderwood glen<br>
Sae dear to this bosom, sae artless and winning<br>
Is charming young Jessie, the flow'r o' Dunblane.<br>
Is charming young Jessie, is charming young Jessie<br>
Is charming young Jessie, the flow'r o' Dunblane.<p>

How lost were my days till I met wi' my Jessie<br>
The sports o' the city seem'd foolish and vain<br>
I ne'er saw a nymph I would ca' my dear lassie<br>
Till charm'd wi' sweet Jessie, the flow'r o' Dublane.<br>
Tho' mine were the station of liftiest grandeur<br>
Amidst its profusion I'd languish in pain<br>
And reckon as naething, the height of its splendour<br>
If wanting sweet Jessie, the flow'r o' Dunblane<br>
If wanting sweet Jessie, if wanting sweet Jessie<br>
If wanting sweet Jessie, the flow'r o' Dunblane.<p>
