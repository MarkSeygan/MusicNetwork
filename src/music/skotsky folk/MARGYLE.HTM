<b>
I have heard the mavis singing<br>
His love song to the morn<br>
I have seen the dew drop clinging<br>
To the rose just newly born<br>
But a sweeter song has cheered me<br>
At the evening's gentle close<br>
And I've seen an eye still brighter<br>
Than the dew drop on the rose<br>
'Twas thy voice my gentle Mary<br>
And thine artless, winning smile<br>
That made this world an Eden<br>
Bonnie Mary of Argyle.<p>

Tho' thy voice may lose its sweetness<br>
And thine eye its brightness too<br>
Tho' thy step may lack its fleetness<br>
And thy hair its sunny hue<br>
Still to me wilt thou be dearer<br>
Than all the world shall own<br>
I have loved thee for thy beauty<br>
But not for that alone<br>
I have sought thy heart, dear Mary<br>
And its goodness was the wile<br>
That has made thee mine forever<br>
Bonnie Mary of Argyle.<p>
