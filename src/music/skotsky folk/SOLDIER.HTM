<b>

There was a soldier, a Scottish soldier<br>
Who wandered far away and soldiered far away<br>
There was none bolder, with good broad shoulder<br>
He's fought in many a fray, and fought and won.<br>
He'd seen the glory and told the story<br>
Of battles glorious and deeds neforious<br>
But now he's sighing, his heart is crying<br>
To leave these green hills of Tyrol.<p>

<i>
Because these green hills are not highland hills<br>
Or the island hills, the're not my land's hills<br>
And fair as these green foreign hills may be<br>
They are not the hills of home.<p>
</i>

And now this soldier, this Scottish soldier<br>
Who wandered far away and soldiered far away<br>
Sees leaves are falling and death is calling<br>
And he will fade away, in that far land.<br>
He called his piper, his trusty piper<br>
And bade him sound a lay... a pibroch sad to play<br>
Upon a hillside, a Scottish hillside<br>
Not on these green hills of Tyrol.<p>

And so this soldier, this Scottish soldier<br>
Will wander far no more and soldier far no more<br>
And on a hillside, a Scottish hillside<br>
You'll see a piper play his soldier home.<br>
He'd seen the glory, he'd told his story<br>
Of battles glorious and deeds victorious<br>
The bugles cease now, he is at peace now<br>
Far from those green hills of Tyrol.
