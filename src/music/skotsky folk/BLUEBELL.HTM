Oh where, tell me where is your highland laddie gone?<br>
Oh where, tell me where is your highland laddie gone?<br>
He's gone with streaming banners where noble deeds are done<br>
And it's oh! in my heart I wish him safe at home.<p>

Oh where, tell me where did your highland laddie dwell?<br>
Oh where, tell me where did your highland laddie dwell?<br>
He dwelt in bonnie Scotland where bloom the sweet bluebells<br>
And it's oh! in my heart I rue my laddie well.<p>

Oh what, tell me what if your highland lad be slain?<br>
Oh what, tell me what if your highland lad be slain?<br>
Oh no, true love will be his guide and bring him safe again<br>
For it's oh! my heart would break if my highland lad were slain.
