<b><i>March Medley</i></b>
<center><h2>Rowan Tree</h2></center>
<b>Oh rowan tree, Oh rowan tree<br>
Thou'lt aye be dear tae me<br>
Entwined thou art wi' mony ties<br>
O' hame and infancy.<p>

Thy leaves were aye the first o' spring<br>
Thy flowers the summer's pride<br>
There was nae sich a bonnie tree<br>
In all the country side.

<center><h2>The Auld Hoose</h2></center>
Oh the auld hoose, the auld hoose<br>
What tho' the rooms were wee<br>
Oh, kind hearts were dwelling there<br>
And bairnies fu' o' glee.<p>

The wild rose and the jasamine<br>
Still hang up on the wa'<br>
Hoo mony cherished memories<br>
Do they sweet flow'rs reca'.

<center><h2>Bonnie Lass Of Fyvie</h2></center>
There was a troop o' Irish Dragoons<br>
Cam' marchin' doon through Fyvie-O<br>
An' their Captain fell in love wi' a very bonnie lass<br>
An' her name it was ca'd pretty Peggy-O.<p>

There's mony a bonnie lass frae the Howe o' Auchterless<br>
There's mony a bonnie lass in the Garioch-O<br>
O' there's mony a bonnie Jean in the toon of Aberdeen<br>
But the floo'er o' them a' is in Fyvie-O.

<center><h2>We're No Awa' Tae Bide Awa'</h2></center>
We're no awa' tae bide awa'<br>
We're no awa' tae leave ye<br>
We're no awa' tae bide awa<br>
We'll aye come back tae see ye.<p>

(Repeat this chorus)
