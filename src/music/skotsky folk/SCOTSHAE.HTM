<b>
Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled<br>
Scots, wham Bruce has aften led<br>
Welcome to your gory bed<br>
Or to victory!<br>
Now's the day an' now's the hour<br>
See the front of battle lour<br>
See approach proud Edward's pow'r<br>
Chains and slavery!<p>

Wha would be a traitor knave?<br>
Wha would fill a coward's grave?<br>
Wha sae base as be a slave?<br>
Let him turn and flee!<br>
Wha for Scotland's king an' law<br>
Freedom's sword would strongly draw<br>
Freeman stand and freeman fa'<br>
Let him on wi' me!<p>

By oppression's woes and pains<br>
By your sons in servile chains<br>
We will drain our dearest veins<br>
But they shall be free.<br>
Lay the proud userpers low!<br>
Tyrants fall in ev'ry foe<br>
Liberty's in every blow<br>
Let us do or dee!<p>
