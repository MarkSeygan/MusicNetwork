<b>
Oh my love she's but a lassie yet<br>
Oh my love she's but a lassie yet<br>
We'll let her stand a year or twa<br>
She'll no be half sae saucy yet.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
I rue the day I sought her, O<br>
I rue the day I sought her, O<br>
Wha gets her needs na say she's woo'd<br>
But he may say he's bought her, O!</i><p>

Come draw a drap o' the best o't yet<br>
Come draw a drap o' the best o't yet<br>
Gae seek for pleasure where you will<br>
But here I never missed it yet.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

We're a' dry wi' drinkin' o't<br>
We're a' dry wi' drinkin' o't<br>
The minister kiss'd the fiddler's wife<br>
He could na preach for thinking o't.<p>
