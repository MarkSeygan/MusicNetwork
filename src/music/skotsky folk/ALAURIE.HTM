<b>
Maxwelton's braes are bonnie<br>
Where early fa's the dew<br>
And 'twas there that Annie Laurie<br>
Gave me her promise true.<br>
Gave me her promise true<br>
Which ne'er forgot will be<br>
And for bonnie Annie Laurie<br>
I'd lay me doon and dee.<p>

Her brow is like the snowdrift<br>
Her throat is like the swan<br>
Her face it is the fairest<br>
That e'er the sun shone on.<br>
That e'er the sun shone on<br>
And dark blue is her e'e<br>
And for bonnie Annie Laurie<br>
I'd lay me doon and dee.<p>

Like dew on th'gowan lying<br>
Is th' fa' o'her fairy feet<br>
And like the winds in summer sighing<br>
Her voice is low and sweet.<br>
Her voice is low and sweet<br>
And she's a' the world to me<br>
And for bonnie Annie Laurie<br>
I'd lay me doon and dee.
