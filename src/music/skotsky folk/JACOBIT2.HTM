<b>
Ye Jacobites by name give an ear, give an ear<br>
Ye Jacobites by name give an ear<br>
Ye Jacobites by name your faults I will proclaim<br>
Your doctrines I must blame, you shall hear.<p>

What is right and what is wrong by the law, by the law<br>
What is right and what is wrong by the law<br>
What is right and what is wrong, a short sword and a long<br>
A weak arm and a strong for to draw.<p>

What makes heroic strife famed afar, famed afar?<br>
What makes heroic strife famed afar?<br>
What makes heroic strife, to whet the assassin's knife<br>
Or hunt a parent's life with bloody war.<p>

Then leave your schemes alone in the state, in the state<br>
Then leave your schemes alone in the state<br>
Then leave your schemes alone, adore the rising sun<br>
And leave a man alone to his fate.<p>

Then leave your schemes alone, adore the rising sun<br>
And leave a man alone to his fate...<br>
And leave a man alone to his fate.
