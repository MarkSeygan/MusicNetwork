<b>
The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended<br>
The darkness falls at thy behest;<br>
To thee our morning hymns ascended<br>
Thy praise shall sanctify our rest.<p>

We thank thee that thy Church unsleeping<br>
While earth rolls onward into light<br>
Through all the world her watch is keeping<br>
And rests not now by day or night.<p>

As o'er each continent and island<br>
The dawn leads on another day;<br>
The voice of prayer is never silent,<br>
Nor dies the strain of praise away.<p>

The sun that bids us rest is waking<br>
Our brethren 'neath the western sky,<br>
And hour by hour fresh lips are making<br>
Thy wondrous doings heard on high.<p>

So be it, Lord! Thy throne shall never,<br>
Like earth's proud empires, pass away;<br>
Thy kingdom stands and grows forever,<br>
Till all thy creatures own thy sway.
