<b>
It was upon a Lammas night<br>
When corn rigs are bonnie, O!<br>
Beneath the moon's unclouded light<br>
I held awa' to Annie, O!<br>
The time flew by with tentless heed<br>
Till 'tween the late and early, O!<br>
Wi' smar' persuasion she agreed to<br>
See me thro' the barley, O!<p>

<i>Chorus:<br>
Corn rigs and barley rigs<br>
Corn rigs are bonnie<br>
I'll ne'er forget that happy night<br>
Amang the rigs wi' Annie, O!<p>
</i>

The sky was blue, the wind was still<br>
The moon was shining clearly, O!<br>
I set her down wi' right good will<br>
Amang the rigs o' barley, O!<br>
I kent her heart was a' my ain<br>
I loved her most sincerely, O!<br>
I kissed her owre and owre again<br>
Amang the rigs o' barley, O!<p>

I locked in my fond embrace<br>
Her heart was beating rarely, O!<br>
My blessings on that happy place<br>
Amang the rigs o' barley, O!<br>
But by the moon and stars so bright<br>
That shone that hour so clearly, O!<br>
She aye shall bless that happy night<br>
Amang the rigs o' barley, O!<p>

I hae been blythe wi' comrades dear<br>
I hae been merry drinkin', O!<br>
I hae been joyful gatherin' gear<br>
I hae been happy thinkin', O!<br>
But a' the pleasures e'er I saw<br>
Tho' three times doubles fairly, O!<br>
That happy night was worth them a'<br>
Amang the rigs o' barley, O!
