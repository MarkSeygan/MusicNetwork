<center><h2>March Of The Cameron Men</h2></center>
<b>
There's many a man of the Cameron clan<br>
That has followed his chief to the field<br>
He has sworn to support him or die by his side<br>
For a Cameron never can yield.<p>

<i>
I hear the pibroch sounding, sounding<br>
Deep o'er the mountain and glen<br>
While light springing footsteps<br>
Are trampling the heath<br>
'Tis the march of the Cameron men.<br>
'Tis the march, 'tis the march<br>
'Tis the march of the Cameron men.<p>
</i>

Oh, proudly they walk, but each Cameron knows<br>
He may tread on the heather no more<br>
But boldly he follows his chief to the field<br>
Where his laurels were gathered before.<p>

The moon has arisen, it shines on the path<br>
Now trod by the gallant and true<br>
High, high are their hopes, for their chieftain has said<br>
That whatever men dare, they can do.
