<b>
Farewell to Tarwathie, adieu Mormond Hill<br>
And the dear land of Crimond, I bid you farewell<br>
I'm bound all for Greenland and ready to sail<br>
In hopes to find riches in hunting the whale.<p>

Farewell to my comrades, for a while we must part<br>
And likewise the dear lass who first won my heart<br>
The cold coast of Greenland, my love will not chill<br>
And the longer my absence, more loving she'll feel.<p>

Our ship is well-rigged and she's ready to sail<br>
The crew, they are anxious to follow the whale<br>
Where the icebergs do float and the stormy winds blow<br>
And the land and the ocean are covered with snow.<p>

The cold coast of Greenland is barren and bare<br>
No seed time nor harvest is ever known there<br>
And the birds here sing sweetly on mountain and dale<br>
But there's no bird in Greenland to sing to the whale.<p>

There is no habitation for a man to live there<br>
And the king of that country is the fierce Greenland bear<br>
And there'll be no temptation to tarry long there<br>
With our ship bumper full we will homeward repair.<p>
