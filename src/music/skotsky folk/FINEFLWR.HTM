She sat down below a thorn<br>
<i>Fine flowers in the valley</i><br>
And there she has her sweet babe borne<br>
<i>And the green leaves they grow rarely.</i><p>

Smile nae sae sweet, my bonnie babe<br>
<i>Fine flowers in the valley</i><br>
An' ye smile sae sweet, ye'll smile me dead<br>
<i>And the green leaves they grow rarely.</i><p>

She's ta'en out her little penknife<br>
<i>Fine flowers in the valley</i><br>
And twinned the sweet babe o' its life<br>
<i>And the green leaves they grow rarely.</i><p>

She howket a grave by the light o' the moon<br>
<i>Fine flowers in the valley</i><br>
And there she's buried her sweet babe in<br>
<i>And the green leaves they grow rarely.</i><p>

As she was going to the Church<br>
<i>Fine flowers in the valley</i><br>
She saw a sweet babe in the porch<br>
<i>And the green leaves they grow rarely.</i><p>

O sweet babe, an' thou wert mine<br>
<i>Fine flowers in the valley</i><br>
I wad cleed thee in silk so fine<br>
<i>And the green leaves they grow rarely.</i><p>

O mother dear, when I was thine<br>
<i>Fine flowers in the valley</i><br>
You did na prove to me sae kind<br>
<i>And the green leaves they grow rarely.</i><p>
