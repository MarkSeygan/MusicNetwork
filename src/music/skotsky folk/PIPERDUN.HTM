<b>
The piper came to out town,<br>
To our town, to our town<br>
The piper came to our town<br>
And he played bonnielie*<br>
He play'd a spring the laird to please<br>
A spring brent new from 'yont the seas<br>
And then he gae his bags a wheeze<br>
And played anither key<p>

And wasna he a rougey, a rougey, a rougey<br>
And wasna he a rougey, the piper o' Dundee<p>

He play'd "The Welcome Ower the Main"<br>
And "Ye's Be Fou and I'se be Fain"<br>
And "Auld Stuart's Back Again"<br>
Wi' muckle mirth and glee<br>
He'd play'd "The Kirk", he play'd "The Queer"<br>
"The Mullen Dhu" and "Chevalier"<br>
And "Lang Awa' But Welcome Here"<br>
Sae sweet, sae bonnielie<p>

It's some gat swords and some gat nane<br>
And some were dancing mad their lane<br>
And mony a vow o' weir<br>
Was ta'en that night at Amulrie<br>
There was Tillibardine, and Burleigh<br>
And Struan, Keith, and Olgivie<br>
And brave Carnegie, wha' but he,<br>
The piper o' Dundee.
