<b>
The sky was clear, the morn was fair<br>
Not a breath came over the sea<br>
When Mary left her highland home<br>
And wandered forth with me<br>
Though flowers decked the mountainside<br>
And fragrance filled the vale<br>
By far the sweetest flower there<br>
Was the rose of Allandale.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
Sweet rose of Allandale<br>
Sweet rose of Allandale<br>
By far the sweetest flower there<br>
Was the rose of Allandale.</i><p>

Where'er I wander to the east and to the west<br>
And fate began to lower<br>
A solace still was she to me<br>
In sorrow's lonely hour<br>
Though tempest wreck my lonely barque<br>
And may rend the quivering sail<br>
One maiden warm withstood the storm<br>
'Twas the rose of Allandale.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

And when my feeble lips were parched<br>
On Africa's burning sands<br>
She whispered hopes of happiness<br>
And tales of foreign lands<br>
My life had been a wilderness<br>
Unblessed by fortune's gales<br>
Had fate not linked my lot to her<br>
Sweet rose of Allandale.
