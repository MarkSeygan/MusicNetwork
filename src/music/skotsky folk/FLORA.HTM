<center><h2>Flora Macdonald's Lament</h2></center>
<b>
Far over yon hills of the heather so green<br>
And down by the corrie that sings to the sea<br>
The bonnie young Flora sat sighing her lane<br>
The dew on her plaid and the tear in her e'e.<br>
She looked at a boat with the breezes that swung<br>
Away on the wave like a bird on the main<br>
And aye as it lessened she sighed and she sung<br>
Farewell to the lad I shall ne'er see again.<br>
Farewell to my hero, the gallant and young<br>
Farewell to the lad I shall ne'er see again.<p>

The moorcock that craws on the brow of Ben Connal<br>
He kens o' his bed in a sweet mossy hame<br>
The eagle that soars on the cliffs of Clanronald<br>
Unawed and unhunted, his eyrie can claim<br>
The solan can sleep on his shelve of the shore<br>
The cormorant roost on his rock of the sea<br>
But oh! There is one whose hard fate I deplore<br>
Nor house, manor hame, in this country has he<br>
The conflict is past and our name is no more<br>
There's nought left but sorrow for Scotland and me.<p>

The target is torn from the arm of the just<br>
The helmet is cleft on the brow of the brave<br>
The claymore forever in darkness must rust<br>
But red is the sword of the stranger and slave<br>
The hoof of the horse and the foot of the proud<br>
Have trod o'er the plumes on the bonnet of blue<br>
Why slept the red bolt in the breast of the cloud<br>
When tyranny revelled in blood of the true?<br>
Farewell, my young hero! The gallant and good<br>
The crown of thy fathers is torn from thy brow.<br>
