<b>
Farewell, ye dungeons dark and strong<br>
Farewell, farewell to thee.<br>
Macpherson's rant will ne'er be lang<br>
On yonder gallows tree.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
Sae rantingly, sae wontonly<br>
Sae dauntingly gaed he<br>
He played a tune an' he danced aroon<br>
Beneath the gallows tree.<p>
</i>

It was by a woman's treacherous hand<br>
That I was condemned to dee<br>
Beneath a ledge at a window she stood<br>
And a blanket she threw o'er me.<p>

Well the laird o' Grant, that highlan' sa'nt<br>
That first laid hands on me<br>
He played the cause on Peter Broon<br>
To let Macpherson dee.<p>

Untie these bands from off my hands<br>
And gie to me my sword<br>
There's nae a man in a' Scotland<br>
But I'll brave him at a word.<p>

There's some come here to see me hanged<br>
And some to buy my fiddle<br>
But before that I do part wi' her<br>
I'll brak her thro' the middle.<p>

He took the fiddle into both his hands<br>
And he broke it o'er a stone<br>
Says there's nae other hand shall play on thee<br>
When I am dead and gone.<p>

O, little did my mother think<br>
When she first cradled me<br>
That I would turn a rovin' boy<br>
And die on the gallows tree.<p>

The reprive was comin' o'er the brig o' Banff<br>
To let Macpherson free<br>
But they pit the clock a quarter afore<br>
And hanged him to a tree.
