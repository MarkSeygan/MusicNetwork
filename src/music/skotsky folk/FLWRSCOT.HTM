O flower of Scotland<br>
When will we see<br>
Your like again<br>
That fought and died for<br>
Your wee bit hill and glen<br>
And stood against him<br>
Proud Edward's army<br>
And sent him homeward<br>
Tae think again.<p>

The hills are bare now<br>
And autumn leaves lie<br>
Thick and still<br>
O'er land that is lost now<br>
Which those so dearly held<br>
And stood against him<br>
Proud Edward's army<br>
And sent him homeward<br>
Tae think again.<p>

Those days are passed now<br>
And in the past<br>
They must remain<br>
But we can still rise now<br>
And be the nation again<br>
That stood against him<br>
Proud Edward's army<br>
And sent him homeward<br>
Tae think again.
