<b>
A far croonin' is pullin' me away<br>
As take I wi' my cromack to the road.<br>
The far Coolins are puttin' love on me<br>
As step I wi' the sunlight for my load.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
Sure by Tummel and Loch Rannoch and Lochaber I will go<br>
By heather tracks wi' heaven in their wiles.<br>
If it's thinkin' in your inner heart the braggart's in my step<br>
You've never smelled the tangle o' the Isles.<br>
Oh the far Coolins are puttin' love on me<br>
As step I wi' my cromack to the Isles.<p>
</i>

It's by Shiel water the track is to the west<br>
By Aillort* and by Morar to the sea<br>
The cool cresses I am thinkin' of for pluck<br>
And bracken for a wink on Mother knee.<p>

The blue islands are pullin' me away<br>
Their laughter puts the leap upon the lame<br>
The blue islands from the Skerries to the Lewis<br>
Wi' heather honey taste upon each name.
