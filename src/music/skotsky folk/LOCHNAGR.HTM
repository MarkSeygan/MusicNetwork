<b>
Away ye gay landscapes, ye gardens of roses<br>
In you let the minions of luxury rove<br>
Restore me the rocks where the snowflake reposes<br>
If still they are sacred to freedom and love.<br>
Yet Caledonia, dear are thy mountains<br>
Round their white summits tho' elements war<br>
Tho' cataracts foam 'stead of smooth flowing fountains<br>
I sigh for the valley of dark Lochnagar.<p>

Ah, there my young footsteps in infancy wandered<br>
My cap was the bonnet, my coat was the plaid<br>
On chieftains departed my memory pondered<br>
As daily I strayed thro' the pine covered glade.<br>
I sought not my home till the day's dying glory<br>
Gave place to the rays of the bright polar star<br>
For fancy was cheered by traditional story<br>
Disclosed by the natives of dark Lochnagar.<p>

Years have rolled on, Lochnagar, since I left you<br>
Years must elapse ere I see you again<br>
Tho' nature of verdure and flowers has bereft you<br>
Yet still thou art dearer than Albion's plain.<br>
England thy beauties are tame and domestic<br>
To one who has roved on the mountains afar<br>
Oh! For the crags that are wild and magestic<br>
The steep frowning glories of dark Lochnagar.
