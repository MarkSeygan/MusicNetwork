<b>
Tae the lairds i' convention t'was Claverhouse spoke<br>
E'er the Kings crown go down, there are crowns to be broke<br>
Then each cavalier who loves honour and me<br>
Let him follow the bonnet o' bonnie Dundee.<p>

<i>
Chorus <br>
Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can<br>
Come saddle my horses and call out my men<br>
Unhook the west port and let us gae free,<br>
For it's up wi' the bonnets o' bonnie Dundee!<p>
</i>

Dundee he is mounted, he rides doon the street,<br>
The bells they ring backwards, the drums they are beat,<br>
But the Provost, douce man, says "Just e'en let it be<br>
For the toun is well rid of that de'il o' Dundee."<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

There are hills beyond Pentland and lands beyond Forth,<br>
Be there lords i' the south, there are chiefs i' the north!<br>
There are brave Duinnewassels, three thousand times three<br>
Will cry "Hey!" for the bonnets o' bonnie Dundee.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

Then awa' to the hills, to the lea, to the rocks<br>
Ere I own a usurper, I'll crouch with the fox<br>
And tremble, false whigs, in the midst of your glee<br>
Ye hae no seen the last o' my bonnets and me!
