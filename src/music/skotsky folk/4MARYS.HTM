<b>
Last night there were four Marys<br>
Tonight there'll be but three<br>
There was Mary Seaton and Mary Beaton<br>
And Mary Carmichael and me.<p>

Oh, often have I dressed my Queen<br>
And put on her braw silk gown<br>
But all the thanks I've got tonight<br>
Is to be hanged in Edinborough Town.<p>

Full often have I dressed my Queen<br>
Put gold upon her hair<br>
But I have got for my reward<br>
The gallows to be my share.<p>

Oh, little did my mother know<br>
The day she cradled me<br>
The land I was to travel in<br>
The death I was to dee.<p>

Oh, happy, happy is the maid<br>
That's born of beauty free<br>
Oh, it was my rosy, dimpled cheeks<br>
That's been the devil to me.<p>

They'll tie a kerchief around my eyes<br>
That I may not see to dee<br>
And they'll never tell my father or mother<br>
But that I'm across the sea.
