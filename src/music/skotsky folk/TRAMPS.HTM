O come a' ye tramps and hawker-lads<br>
An' gaitherers o' bla'<br>
That tramp the country roun' and roun'<br>
Come listen one and a'<br>
I'll tell tae ye a rovin' tale<br>
An' places I hae been<br>
Far up into the snowy north<br>
Or sooth by Gretna Green.<p>
 
I've seen the high Ben Nevis<br>
That gangs towerin' tae the moon<br>
I've been roun' by Crieff an' Callander<br>
An' by Bonny Doon<br>
I've been by Nethy's silvery tide<br>
An' places ill tae ken<br>
Far up into the stormy north<br>
Lies Urquart's fairy glen.<p>

Sometimes noo I laugh tae mysel'<br>
When dodgin' alang the road<br>
Wi' a bag o' meal slung upon my back<br>
My face as broun's a toad<br>
Wi' lumps o'cheese and tattie-scones<br>
Or breid an' braxie ham<br>
Nae thinking whar' I'm comin' frae<br>
Nor thinkin' whar I'm gang.<p>

I'm happy in the summer-time<br>
Beneath the dark blue sky<br>
Nae thinkin' in the mornin'<br>
At nicht where i'm gang to lie<br>
Bothies or byres or barns<br>
Or oot amangst the hay<br>
And if the weather does permit<br>
I'm happy a' the day.<p>

Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond<br>
They've oft been seen by me<br>
The Dee, the Don, the Devron<br>
That a' flows tae the sea<br>
Dunrobin Castle, by the way<br>
I nearly had forgot<br>
And the reckless stanes o'cairn<br>
That mairks the hoose o' John o' Groat.<p>

I've been by bonny Gallowa'<br>
An' often roun' Stranraer<br>
My business leads me anywhere<br>
I travel near an' far<br>
I've got that rovin' notion<br>
I wouldna like tae loss<br>
For It's my daily fare<br>
An' as much'll pay my doss.<p>

I think I'll gang tae Paddy's Lan'<br>
I'm makin' up my mind<br>
For Scotland's greatly altered noo<br>
I canna raise the wind<br>
But if I can trust in Providence<br>
If Providence should prove true<br>
I'll sing ye's a' of Erin's Isle<br>
When I come back to you.
