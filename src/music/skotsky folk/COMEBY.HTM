<center><h2>Come By The Hills</h2></center>
<b>
Come by the hills to a land where fancy is free<br>
And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the lochs reach the sea<br>
Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun<br>
And the cares of tomorrow must wait 'til this day is done.<p>

Come by the hills to the land where life is a song<br>
And sing while the birds fill the air with their joy all day long<br>
Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune<br>
And the cares of tomorrow can wait 'til this day is done.<p>

Come by the hills to a land where legend remains<br>
Where stories of old stir the heart and may yet come again<br>
Where our past has been lost and the future has still to be won<br>
And the cares of tomorrow must wait 'til this day is done.<p>
